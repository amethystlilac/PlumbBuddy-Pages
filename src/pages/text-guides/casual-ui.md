Once PlumbBuddy is set up, it will open to the Mod Health tab and start scanning your Mods folder.

First it will start cataloging your mods. It will give an estimated time of how long that will take at the top, and there will be a progress bar. You shouldn’t start the game or make changes to your mods folder while this is happening.

Once PlumbBuddy is done scanning your Mods folder, it will begin analyzing your cache files to see if they need to be deleted. You can go ahead and make changes now. If PlumbBuddy found things that need to be fixed, you can fix them, or you can start your game if you want to play.

The last scan to finish will be the cache, and it will tell you if your cache is fine or needs to be deleted, or if there are no cache files.

After PlumbBuddy finishes cataloging, at the top left, you have:

* The button to open the menu, which is three horizontal lines
* The PlumbBuddy symbol
* A button to open your Downloads folder
* A button to open your Mods folder
* A button to quickly clear your cache files
* An ‘Ask for Help’ button, which will bring up options for getting help, and will guide you through the initial process for getting help if you choose, for example, to go to a general support discord server

If you open the menu, you’ll see:

* The PlumbBuddy symbol, name, and version
* A button to open your downloads folder
* A button to open your mods folder
* A button to quickly clear your cache
* An ‘Ask for Help’ button, which will bring up options for support. You can pick a general support discord server there, and the link for the PlumbBuddy discord server is there if you need help with PlumbBuddy itself.
* A button to check for updates of PlumbBuddy
* The settings button
* A button to close the window (but not shut down PlumbBuddy) on Windows only
* A button to shut down PlumbBuddy on Windows only

On Mac, you just close the window to shutdown PlumbBuddy

If you click the settings button, there are 5 kinds of settings that you can change at this point:

* General, for who you are and to change certain PlumbBuddy settings.
* Theme, to change the theme.
* Folders, to change the folders or to reset them to the default.
* Mod Health, to enable or disable PlumbBuddy’s scans. If you want to change which kinds of warnings PlumbBuddy will give you, you can do it here. If you accidentally (or on purpose) clicked Stop Telling Me and then changed your mind, here is where you can re-enable scans. You can also leave things on default.
* Mod Hound, to change your Mod Hound settings, like how long you keep reports.

Pick which kind of setting you want to change or look at, and when that setting is the way you want it, click OK at the bottom right, or cancel if you don't want to change anything.
