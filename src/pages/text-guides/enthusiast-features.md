### [Mod Health](https://plumbbuddy.app/features/mod-health)

Once you have PlumbBuddy set up and some mods with manifests installed, PlumbBuddy will get to work helping you keep your game running as smoothly as possible.

You might get some alerts right away. PlumbBuddy will do its best to tell you what you need to do. You might be told you have a .zip file in your mods folder, where it’s not supposed to be, or that you have a missing requirement for a mod. You might get a recommendation to download a specific mod that will help you. Or you might have no alerts at all.

If you get an alert and want more information, there will be a question mark on the alert that you can click to bring you to the Mod Health guide's page.

### [Catalog](https://plumbbuddy.app/features/catalog)

If you go to the Catalog tab, you’ll see all of the mods you currently have installed that have manifests. For each one, if the information is included in the manifest, you may see:

* The mod name
* A short description
* The download URL for the mod
* The name(s) of the creator(s)
* An Ask for Help button to seek help with the mod, which will give you options to go to a support avenue specified by the creator if they listed one, or to go to a find general support
* Packs the mod requires (in green on the default theme)
* Packs the mod cannot be used with (in red on the default theme)
* The files that are in the mod
* Any extra mods that the mod requires, as long as they have manifests themselves (dependencies)
* Any other mods that require the mod, as long as they have manifests themselves (dependants)

You can click buttons on the right of the file names or dependency/dependant to look at that file or that mod.

You can search the whole catalogue on the top right of the catalogue, and you can search the mod itself, if you need to, to the right side of the screen.

### [Mod Hound](https://plumbbuddy.app/features/mod-hound)

[Mod Hound](https://app.ts4modhound.com/) is a website created by [Lumpinou](https://www.patreon.com/lumpinou). It's a place where modders can list their mods, including if they were updated, if they're broken or obsolete or working fine with the current patch, and if they require other mods that are also listed on the site. Players can then have the website scan their mods folder for various things.

Mod Hound has collaborated with PlumbBuddy to incorporate these scans into PlumbBuddy. On the Mod Hound tab, you can request that PlumbBuddy send a list of your mods to Mod Hound, and Mod Hound will send back a report that you can view in the app by clicking on the various parts of the report on the left.

It will give you lists of:

* Outdated mods
* Duplicate mods
* Broken/Obsolete mods
* Incompatible mods
* Missing Requirements
* Unknown Status
* Up to Date
* Not Tracked

The report will only give advice about mods that the creator has listed on Mod Hound.

In addition, many of the files in the report will come with buttons to view the file in your mods folder and/or to go to the download page for the mod, or in the case of the missing requirement, to download that.

### [Archivist](https://plumbbuddy.app/features/archivist)

Archivist is there to store and protect your saves.

If you turn Archivist on, it will automatically make backups of your save files, compressed into small files to optimize storage space. You'll no longer be limited to the five in-game slots that get overwritten when you save again, and you can go back to any point in your save's history by branching it or restoring it.

There are two toggles at the top right. The one on the left turns on Archivist and lets you look at files that have already been archived. The one on the right lets Archivist archive new save points. You can turn that one on permanently, or if your computer isn't up to running anything else while the game is running, you might want to just turn it on occasionally.

![image](/img/PB-Archivist.png "The Archivist tab, with a list of saves on the left. One is selected, showing a list of Snapshots on the right. At the top of the list of Snapshots is a sim in a red dress on the left and the name of the save and some details about it to the right.")

### [Parlay](https://plumbbuddy.app/features/parlay)

Have you found a mod that's perfect, but not available in your language? Maybe you know *enough* to get by, but would prefer that you could read it in game without effort. *Maybe* you even want to translate it and share it, but have no idea where to start.

Parlay is an easy way to translate almost any mod into the language of your choice. As you translate, it creates a translation file in your mods folder that you can use yourself, share with others, or share with the mod creator.

While not its purpose, it can also be used to customize the existing strings of a mod to your preference, by creating an override file to change just the text.
