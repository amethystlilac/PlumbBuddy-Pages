Setting up PlumbBuddy is fairly straightforward. There aren't really many ways it can go wrong, but if at any point you change your mind and want to go back and change something, you can use the Previous button in the bottom left. And if you get it all set up and *then* change your mind, you can change things in Settings.

### The Legal Stuff

When you first install and open PlumbBuddy, the first thing you’ll see is the End User License Agreement. You have to agree to this to use PlumbBuddy. Read through it, and then click the Next button at the bottom right.

### Themes

At the top of the themes tab, you can choose the scale of PlumbBuddy's UI. You have options on how to do this: type in the scale you want, use the arrows to increase or decrease the scale, click on the circle on the slider and use the left and right buttons on your keyboard, click and drag the slider (NOT recommended), or hold Ctrl on your keyboard and scroll your mouse wheel or use the + and - buttons on your keyboard. You can reset to the default using the button on the right.

PlumbBuddy has a default light or dark theme based on your computer's settings, but you can choose from a variety of other themes that are included. Some are light mode only, some are dark mode only, and some have both — those follow your computer's settings.

On the second tab, you can pick which one you want to use. Click on them to see what they look like, and click on them again to turn them off. Pick one (or none) for now, and then click next at the bottom right. If you want to, you can change your theme later in Settings.

This guide uses the default dark mode theme, but you can use whatever you want.

### Introductions

On the Introductions tab, you choose if you’re a Casual Player, an Enthusiast Player, or a Mod Creator. Which you choose decides what options are enabled for default for you, how much information is displayed, and what you can do with PlumbBuddy.

By default, Enthusiast Players will have most scans active, and can turn them on or off while setting up PlumbBuddy, and will be shown the number of packages and scripts that are in your mods folder. You can change that while setting up PlumbBuddy, in settings afterwards, or by clicking Stop Telling Me when PlumbBuddy alerts you to something.

Enthusiast Players will also be given more detail about some things, since they've indicated that they're interested.

You can switch between types by clicking the circles at the top (blue for Casual, red for Enthusiast, or green for Creator) or by using the arrows on the sides of the picture.

Pick Enthusiast (red) and click Next at the bottom right.

I'm comfortable with the technical stuff, so don't hold back. I want to see all the options, learn what they do, and exercise full control over them. I may have unusual preferences regarding how I want PlumbBuddy to behave.'")

### Folders

The folders tab is kind of important. PlumbBuddy will auto detect this information. For most people, it's fine to glance at it, make sure it looks okay, and move on.

Everything on this tab is required for PlumbBuddy to work. PlumbBuddy *needs* to know where your game and mods and downloads folder are, and where you want Archivist to put your save file backups if you choose to use Archivist — you don't need to use Archivist if you don't want to, but you do need to set a folder path.

At the top, PlumbBuddy will show:

* Your operating system (Windows or Mac) and its language
    * PlumbBuddy will use that language if a translation in that language exists, but it will default to American English if your language isn’t included
* If it detected the game installed using the EA app
* If it detected the game installed using Steam

![image](/img/PB-folders-OS.png "An image showing that the user is using Windows and English (Canade), with a Reset Paths button below, and the EA App, with a Select button below, and a Steam symbol to the right with no button below")

If you have the game installed using both the EA app and Steam, you can pick which one is used by clicking the Select button underneath that install.

Below that, there are four boxes.

1. The top box is your User Data Folder.
    * This is where your Mods folder is.
    * It must not be named Mods itself in a folder that also contains `Options.ini`.
    * It must contain `Options.ini`.
2. The second box is your Installation Folder.
    * This is where the game is installed.
    * On Windows, it must contain `Game\Bin\TS4_x64.exe`.
    * On Mac, it must contain `Contents/MacOS/The Sims 4`.
3. The third box is your Downloads Folder.
    * By default, this is your computer's regular downloads folder, but you can change it.
    * This is used, for example, if you have a .zip file in your Mods folder and PlumbBuddy offers to move it out for you.
4. The fourth box is where Archivist will store its database, if you activate it.
    * By default, it will be a folder in your Documents folder, but you can put it anywhere you want, including an external drive or cloud storage.
        * Keep in mind that Archivist will get angry if she can't find the location your folder is in, and you may want to deactivate Archivist before removing an external drive she's using.
    * If the folder doesn’t already exist, it will be created when you turn Archivist on.

![image](/img/PB-folders-files.png "An image of the folders as described above, with a Browse button to the right end of each box")

If you change any of these and then you want to go back to the default, click Reset Path for User Data and Downloads and Archivist, under your operating system at the top, and Select for Installation Files, under EA App/Steam.

If anything shows up red here, try clicking Reset Path or Select. If you have a custom setup for the game's installation or user data folder, you may need to tell PlumbBuddy where to find it if it's not auto detected.

![image](/img/PB-folders-error.png "An image of an invalid Download Folder path, with 'Bruh... there's not even a folder there' in red at the bottom")

Once you’ve checked these or changed them, click Next at the bottom right.

### Mod Health

Almost done!

This tab will tell PlumbBuddy some key things that you want it to tell *you*. It's where you choose which scans you want enabled in Mod Health.

Most scan will start out enabled. Scans for checking for the presence of the mods MC Command Center or Better Exceptions are disabled by default. You can choose to enable all, disable all, or pick and choose.

To see all scans in a category, click the symbol at the right of each bar to open a dropdown menu.

1. The top bar is for game options. Click the gear and enable or disable options such as an alert if mods or script mods are disabled, or the mod list is enabled.
2. The second bar is for basic installation errors (files too deep, zip files, etc.) and error files. Click the file icon to enable or disable these.
3. The third bar is for missing encouraged mods, like MCCC. Click the box to enable or disable these.
4. The fourth box is for PlumbBuddy’s suggestions based on its analysis of your mods folder — you should clear your cache, or information it learns from manifested mods, such as multiple versions of the same mod or multiple ‘pick one’ files. Click the refresh symbol to enable or disable these.

You can disable all scans in one section by clicking on the X on the right of the bar.

You can read more about the various Mod Health scans on the [Mod Health](https://plumbbuddy.app/text-guides/enthusiast-mod-health) page.

Once you've made your decisions, click Next on the bottom right.

![image](/img/PB-Setup-ModHealth-Enth.png "An image of the Mod Health settings as described above: four bars with various coloured bubbles inside each with text, representing Mod Health scans. At the right of each bar is an x for removing all scans and a symbol to click to open a dropdown menu. At the bottom are Enable All, Disable All, and Set Default buttons.")

### PlumbBuddy Settings

Here are certain things that PlumbBuddy does by default that you can turn off, and things it doesn't do for you by default that you can turn on.

* You can turn on auto checking for PlumbBuddy updates, which is off by default. This would make sure that you always know if your PlumbBuddy app has all the latest features and bug fixes.
* You can turn on offering to help you find mod update news after you’ve updated your game.
* You can turn off the global manifest package. This is a file that will be created in your Mods folder which makes the information PlumbBuddy has about the mods installed in your Mods folder available so that other mods can make use of it.
* You can turn on PlumbBuddy having an icon in the system tray on Windows.

Once you’ve made a decision, click Finish on the bottom right.

![image](/img/PB-PBsettings-Enth.png "An image of the PlumbBuddy app settings, with 'Automatically check for updates' and 'Offer to find mod update news when the game is patched' toggled off,  'Generate global manifest package' toddled on, and 'Show an icon in the system tray' toggled off")

And we're done!

Once you've finished the basic setup, PlumbBuddy will begin scanning your Mods folder for any issues. 

While that finishes, you might want to head over to [User Interface Overview](https://plumbbuddy.app/text-guides/enthusiast-ui) to see what's happening.
