If you still need help with PlumbBuddy, please join our discord server. The link's in the menu at the left, and also [right here](https://discord.gg/XKbMEEfRde). After you read and accept the rules:

* Go to the `#roles` channel at the top of the channels list, read each post with reactions and click the ones appropriate for you.
* If you're there for help as a mod user, go to the `#user_support` channel in the `Mod User Area` category of the channels list.
* If you're there for help as a creator, go to the `#creator_support` channel in the `Mod Creator Area' category of the channels list.
* Describe your issue, and wait for a support team member to be available. Please remember that our support team is made up of **volunteers**, and if no one's available, you may need to try again later.

You can also find a link to our discord server using the Ask For Help button at the top of the PlumbBuddy app or in PlumbBuddy's menu. Click the `Get Help With PlumbBuddy` link at the top right of the menu that opens.
