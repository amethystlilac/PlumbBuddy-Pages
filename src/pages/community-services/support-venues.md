When a player gets an error, or when they need help with a mod, or when they need help with anything game related, there’s a convenient button in PlumbBuddy that hey can click and be guided through finding that help. If you want to offer help with your own mods or help in general, here’s how you can do that.

##### Option 1: Discord
1. [Join the PlumbBuddy Discord Server](https://discord.gg/XKbMEEfRde). You’ll need to agree to the rules and take the Creator role.
2. Come to the `#resources_and_templates` channel, in the `MOD CREATOR AREA` section. Create a thread by clicking the spool of thread at the top.
3. Copy one (or more) of the templates there and fill in your information. Make sure it’s clear which kind(s) of support you want to offer. You need to fill out one form for each kind of support, but you only need one thread at a time.
4. Wait for us to see your thread. We may have further questions, or your next notification may be that we have actioned your request.
5. Once we’ve completed the process, the thread will be closed. If you need to update your information, or if you decide to no longer offer support, please open a new thread.
##### Option 2: Github
1. There is one file that needs to be updated, linked below. It is kept in [the GitHub repository for this website](https://github.com/lama-Logic/PlumbBuddy-Pages). The easiest way to do that is to fork the repo, alter those files, and submit a pull request. To see how to do that, you can review [this video](https://youtu.be/usTVkhbDjmE).
2. Please keep your edit in alphabetical order, by server name.
3. Follow the examples given by the other servers listed. The format is important. If you want an option not shown (say, you do only mac support), ask if it can be done.
4. For your help steps, icons are sourced from [this Material Design Icons Catalog](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/).
   * They must not have outline in the name.
   * Remove dashes and CapitalizeEachWord.
5. Before you make your pull request, make sure to test the file. Download it, go to your PB installation (click the heart in the menu 10 times to access Dev Tools if you don’t know where that is) and replace the support-discords.yml file already in PlumbBuddy's cache.
6. If PlumbBuddy displays an error when you use the **Ask For Help** function, you formatted it wrong. If you don’t get an error, check that everything looks right, and then submit your pull request. You may be asked for more information or to make changes. Please subscribe to notifications on the pull request and watch the email associated with your Github account to avoid having it denied due to non-responsiveness.
