          I'm about to escort you to the Discord created by my creators specifically for getting help with me. But before I do, you should know they will have the following expectations of you.
          1. Be kind and respectful of others opinions.
          2. Keep discussions of real world political and religious topics out of this **gaming** server.
          3. Do **not** DM people in this server, including the mods and admins.
          4. We don't care how you got the game but do **not** talk about piracy. This could result in a ban at moderator/admin discretion.
          5. Ban appeals are only accepted through the form linked on the website. If you send a ban appeal through DM, it will be refused.
          6. Keep NSFW links and discussion to the designated NSFW channels. While NSFW topics are allowed in the appropriate channels, severely NSFW topics or illegal content are not. No discussion of or links to anything that includes rape, bestiality, or pedophilia. This will result in a ban at moderator/admin discretion. If you are a minor and are discovered accessing NSFW channels, you may be banned at moderator/admin discretion.
          If you agree to abide by all of the above, click the **Next** button to continue.

          The first thing you'll probably want to do is find out if your problem is from a mod or from the game.<br>
          First, make sure PlumbBuddy is not generating a global manifest right now using the toggle switch below. Then, either move your entire mods folder somewhere safe, like a folder on your desktop, or rename it where it is. No need to delete anything except your cache files. You can use the handy button below clear your cache.<br>
          Check if your problem continues with your mods removed.<br>
          This should tell you if your problem is from the game or from something in your mods folder. But be careful! Sometimes you can get errors from *removing* mods and custom content too. And make sure not to save with your mods and CC removed, or you'll be removing your mods and CC from your save. No one likes bald and naked sims (unless that's what you mean to have).<br>
          If the problem continues with your mods and cc removed, you might want to try a [game repair](https://simsafterdark.com/diy-troubleshooting-library/how-to-folder-refresh-game-repair/).

          There are some kind people who take the time to collect reports about mods and cc that cause issues in games.<br>
          There's LuthienRising, who maintains a list of broken mods and custom content at Answers HQ. The current version of her list is listed [here](https://forums.ea.com/discussions/the-sims-4-mods-and-custom-content-en/mod--cc-issues-start-here/5035292). It's important to note that her list only includes things that follow EA's T for Teen rating and otherwise follow AHQ's rules. Older lists will be linked too, if you need to go back further.<br>
          There's Scarlet, who keeps a list of all (or most) mods. There are 4 different versions of the list, and you can pick the one that fits your needs [here](https://scarletsrealm.com/the-mod-list/). Scarlet's list may contain more mods than LuthienRising's, but it doesn't include custom content unless it breaks as a category (all beds, for example). Make sure to check the Obsolete list too! It's linked at the top of the page.<br>
          If you're a member of a sims discord server, you may have seen a mod news feed from the Sims After Dark or the Deaderpool discord servers. These contain valuable information about which mods have broken or been updated, and they're updated daily.<br>
          If you're not a member of a discord server that has that feed, you can always join the servers themselves. You can join the [Sims After Dark server](http://discord.gg/simsafterdark) and see the `#general-mod-news` channel in the `Announcements and News` section, or you can join the [Deaderpool server](http://discord.gg/MCCC) and see the `#mod-news` channel in the `Bulletin Board` section. You can scroll back as far as you need to.<br>

          The Sims After Dark website has a lot of resources that will help you troubleshoot your own game.<br>
          This includes a beginner's guide to modding, how to find the mod or CC that's breaking your game (or just doing something you don't want), how to batch fix your CC, and how to survive a patch, among others.<br>

          Sometimes it's not a mod. Sometimes it's just the game misbehaving, or something about your system that's not happy.<br>
          The EA Forums have a Bug Reports area where you can search for other people who have your same issue and see what they did to fix it, or post about your own experience and someone might know a workaround. You might even call attention from the Sims team to your issue! They have to know it's a problem if they're going to fix it. [Click here](https://forums.ea.com/idea/the-sims-4-bug-reports-en/general-information-about-the-bug-reports-forum/4965007) to go to the Bug Report forum.<br>
          If it's not a bug, but rather a technical problem, you can try the Technical Issues forum instead. There's a [Windows](https://forums.ea.com/category/the-sims-4-en/discussions/the-sims-4-technical-issues-pc-en) section, a [Mac](https://forums.ea.com/category/the-sims-4-en/discussions/the-sims-4-technical-issues-mac-en) section, and a section for [Consoles](https://forums.ea.com/category/the-sims-4-en/discussions/the-sims-4-technical-issues-consoles-en).<br>
          You can also leave feedback in [The Sims 4 Feedback](https://forums.ea.com/category/the-sims-4-en/discussions/the-sims-4-feedback-en) section, if there's something that you don't like but that they don't consider to be an official bug, or ask a question in [The Sims 4 Gameplay Questions & Issues](https://forums.ea.com/category/the-sims-4-en/discussions/the-sims-4-gameplay-en).
